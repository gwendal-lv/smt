# Sound Morphing Toolbox (SMT) 0.1.1

The SMT is a set of Matlab functions that implement sound morphing algorithms for isolated musical instrument sounds. The SMT was first presented at https://www.mcgill.ca/timbre2018/.

## Use

Download the files to a folder, e.g., /userhome/myfolder

Start Matlab

Add /userhome/myfolder to your Matlab path

Run the Matlab script 'run_smt.m'

## Dependencies

The file 'run_smt_dependencies.txt' lists all file dependencies. All required .m files can be found in this SMT repository. However, the SMT also requires the Matlab signal processing toolbox.
